		<h2>Front-end Web Development Lab</h2>
		<h3>Instructor: Dr. Phu Phong</h3>
		<h3>Student: Isaac Jacobsohn</h3>

			In this course, we study basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks are introduced and explored with hands-on exercises. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.
